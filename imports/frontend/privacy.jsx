        <h3>Cookies </h3>
        Cookies are small files placed on your computer’s hard drive that
        enables the website to identify your computer as you view different
        pages. Cookies allow websites and applications to store your preferences
        to present contents, options, or functions that are specific to you.
        Like most interactive websites, our website uses cookies to enable the
        tracking of your activity for the duration of a session. Our website
        uses only encrypted session cookies which are erased either after a
        predefined timeout period or once the user logs out of the platform and
        closes the browser. Session cookies do not collect information from the
        user’s computer. They will typically store information in the form of a
        session identification that does not personally identify the user.
        <br />
        <h3>How we protect your personal information</h3>
        We store and process your personal information on our computers in
        Nigeria. Where we need to transfer your data to another country, such a
        country must have an adequate data protection law. We will seek your
        consent where we need to send your data to a country without an adequate
        data protection law. We protect your information using physical,
        technical, and administrative security measures to reduce the risks of
        loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, and alteration. Some of
        the safeguards we use are firewalls and data encryption, physical access
        controls to our data centers, and information access authorization
        controls.
        <br />
        <h3>How We Share your information within TRUTHX and other users</h3>
        During your interaction with any of our platforms or premises, we may
        provide Ministries, Departments, Agencies (MDAs), other organs of
        government, private sector operators performing government functions,
        with information such as your name, contact details, or other details
        you provide us to perform their statutory mandate to you or third
        parties. We work with third parties, banks, financial institutions, and
        corporate bodies to perform TRUTHX's services and implement its mandate.
        In doing so, a third party may share information about you with us, such
        as your email address or mobile phone number. You accept that your
        pictures and testimonials on all social media platforms about TRUTHX can
        be used for limited promotional purposes by us. This does not include

        between two points such as your device and the connecting server. Any
        data transmitted during the session will be encrypted before
        transmission and decrypted at the receiving end. This is to ensure that
        data cannot be read during transmission. TRUTHX has also taken measures
        to comply with global Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) we,
        therefore, have put in place digital and physical security measures to
